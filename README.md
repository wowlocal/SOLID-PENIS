## Description
### Single responsibility principle
THERE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN ONE REASON FOR A CLASS TO CHANGE
### Open closed principle
SOFTWARE ENTITIES (CLASSES, MODULES, FUNCTIONS, ETC.) SHOULD BE OPEN FOR EXTENSION, BUT CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION.
### The Liskov Substitution Principle
FUNCTIONS THAT USE POINTERS OR REFERENCES TO BASE CLASSES MUST BE ABLE TO USE OBJECTS OF DERIVED CLASSES WITHOUT KNOWING IT.
### The Interface Segregation Principle
CLIENTS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO DEPEND UPON INTERFACES THAT THEY DO NOT USE.
### The Dependency Inversion Principle
A. HIGH LEVEL MODULES SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON LOW LEVEL MODULES. BOTH SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS.
B. ABSTRACTIONS SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON DETAILS. DETAILS SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS.
### Polymorphism
### Encapsulation
### Nested avoidance principle
### Inheritance plane
### Style guide compliance
